00:01:54,366 --> 00:02:01,133
like she would never get this drunk or wear that kind of dress

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,466
or be caught dead in that club with those girls

36

your new friends are clearly a bad influence on you

40
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,566

43
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,599

and you wouldn't have been able to stop them

64
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,800

00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:05,299
finally she's come to her senses

96
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,933
finally she realizes that we're meant to be together

97
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,199
finally she's ready to stop running around acting

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,366
